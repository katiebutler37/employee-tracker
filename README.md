## Description
- The motivation for creating this repository was to help a small business owner to view and manage the departments, roles and employees in their company.
- This application helps to organize the workplace to plan a business.
- While creating this application, I was able to strengthen existing knowledge of Node.js and Inquirer while applying my newly learned skills of querying SQL Databases to present that desired format of information to the client through the command line.
